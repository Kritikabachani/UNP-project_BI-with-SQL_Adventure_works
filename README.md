# UNP-project_BI-with-SQL_Adventure_works

This project was finished as a requirement for my internship at United Network of Professionals (UNP).This SQL project involves querying a database, likely from a retail or sales context, to extract valuable insights. The queries cover a range of analyses, including total revenue by category and region, average order value, daily sales trends, product profitability, customer count, and territory-wise sales. These queries provide a comprehensive view of the business's performance, aiding decision-making and strategic planning
The project was completed in three stages:

Step - 1 Creating an Adventure Works database.

Create the tables with the columns mentioned.
Put the constraints (primary key, foreign key etc) in the columns.
